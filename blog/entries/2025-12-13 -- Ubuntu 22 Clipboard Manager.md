## Describe the issue

I was looking for a clipboard manager to keep a history and a list of things I've copied. I use [Clippy](https://github.com/Clipy/Clipy) for MacOs and i enjoy it's functionality.

## Research:

Doing some quick research for Ubuntu and i found a few options:

[gnome-shell-extension-clipboard-indicator](https://github.com/Tudmotu/gnome-shell-extension-clipboard-indicator)

[CopyQ](https://github.com/hluk/CopyQ) - Eventual Winner

I first went to their respective GitHub pages to compare stars, just to get a gauge on their popularity.

## First Attempts

I tried to use the gnome extension one first, but was unsuccessful following their readme. I don't want to tinker with things too much, so i moved on fairly quickly to the next one.

## Winner

I installed CopyQ quickly with their command line instructions and got straight into it.

I wanted to set a keyboard shortcut for the little popup window that shows the list of past snippets/copies, and after about 5 minutes i had that going.

That's all i really wanted, and it provides the solution.

### A little funk

It is a little funky, as in when i use the menu to choose an item from the past, it takes almost a full second to paste it. That feels really weird when your just simply on a local application. I mean we're just copying text, so it feels weird that there's a lag to it.

## Conclusion

But without going further into researching and more into the rabbit hole for this, i'm just going to call it good and move along.

For now, CopyQ is the winner. It was very easy to install and get setup. There's a quick toggle for ensuring it starts up on system startup, and the keyboard shortcuts were intuit enough for me to figure things out without tinkering too deeply.

It definitely seems this tool has much deeper functionalities for those who enjoy that kind of thing, but for me it's just enough. I do hope that i can find one that's a bit smoother in operation in the future, and I'm a little upset that it's not easier to pin a particular item to the list, but i'll leave those dreams for the future. Hopefully I'll find something better another time, but this is good enough to put that need on the shelf for now.
